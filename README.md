# asynchronous-network-server

A simple asynchronous network server that handles incoming HTTP requests. In this case, the network server is handling the contents of textfiles that are found within the project location. The program starts off by generating 100 textfiles with random characters written to them. This was done to establish that the text files were properly being displayed on the localhost.
